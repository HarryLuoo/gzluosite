# Welcome to My New Website!

I'm excited to launch my personal website built with Jekyll and the beautiful Hamilton theme. This site will serve as my digital home where I'll share my thoughts, projects, and experiences.

## What's Under the Hood?

This website is built using some fantastic technologies:

- **Jekyll**: A static site generator that's perfect for blogs and personal sites
- **Hamilton Theme**: A clean, minimalist theme that focuses on content
- **GitHub Pages**: Free hosting that automatically builds and deploys the site
- **Decap CMS**: A user-friendly content management system for easy editing

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about various topics including:

- **Technology**: Programming tips, tools, and discoveries
- **Projects**: Showcases of my work and side projects
- **Learning**: Insights from my continuous learning journey
- **Life**: Personal reflections and experiences

## Getting Started with Content Management

One of the best features of this setup is the integrated CMS. I can easily create and edit posts through a web interface at `/admin/`, making content management a breeze.

## Stay Connected

Feel free to explore the site and check back regularly for new content. You can also connect with me on [GitHub](https://github.com/HarryLuoo) to see what I'm working on.

Thanks for visiting, and welcome to my corner of the internet!
