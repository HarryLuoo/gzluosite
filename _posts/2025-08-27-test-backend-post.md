# Test Post from Backend

This is a test post created directly through the custom backend API to verify that:

1. The backend server is running and accessible
2. Files can be saved to the _posts directory
3. Jekyll frontmatter is properly formatted

If this file appears in the _posts directory, the backend is working correctly!
