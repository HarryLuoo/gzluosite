# Custom CMS Backend for Jekyll Site

## ✨ What We Built

We've created a **fully functional custom backend** that saves all CMS changes directly to your local files - no external services needed!

## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Start the Backend Server
Open a terminal and run:
```bash
cd admin
node simple-backend.js
```
Keep this terminal open while using the CMS.

### Step 2: Start Jekyll
In another terminal, run:
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

### Step 3: Access Your CMS
Visit: http://127.0.0.1:4000/gzluosite/admin/

### Step 4: Login and Edit
1. Click "Login" (no credentials needed with test-repo mode)
2. Create/edit posts, pages, and navigation
3. **All changes are automatically saved to your local files!**

## 🎯 Features

- **Real File Persistence**: Changes are saved directly to your repository
- **No Authentication Hassles**: Works locally without OAuth
- **Instant Updates**: See changes immediately in your Jekyll site
- **Full CMS Features**: 
  - Create/edit blog posts with attachments
  - Manage pages (Home, About, Categories, Tags)
  - Edit navigation links
  - Upload images and files

## 📁 How It Works

1. **Backend Server** (`simple-backend.js`): 
   - Runs on port 8081
   - Provides API endpoints for file operations
   - Saves files directly to your repository

2. **CMS Integration** (`index.html`):
   - Intercepts CMS save operations
   - Routes them to our custom backend
   - No external dependencies!

3. **Configuration** (`config.yml`):
   - Uses `test-repo` mode for local development
   - No authentication required

## 🔧 Customization

You can modify `simple-backend.js` to:
- Add authentication if needed
- Change file save locations
- Add custom validation
- Implement version control

## 📝 Publishing Changes

After editing in the CMS:
1. Review changes with `git status`
2. Commit: `git add -A && git commit -m "Update content"`
3. Push: `git push origin main`
4. GitHub Pages will automatically deploy!

## 🎉 Benefits

- **100% Local Control**: Your data never leaves your machine
- **No Service Dependencies**: No OAuth providers or external APIs
- **Lightning Fast**: Direct file system access
- **Developer Friendly**: Easy to understand and modify
- **Free Forever**: No service costs or limits

## 🚨 Important Notes

- Keep the backend server running while using the CMS
- The backend only works on localhost for security
- Changes are saved immediately to your files
- Use Git to track and deploy changes

## 🤝 Troubleshooting

If the CMS doesn't save:
1. Check the backend server is running
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Ensure you're on localhost/127.0.0.1
4. Try refreshing the CMS page

This custom solution gives you complete control over your CMS without any external dependencies!
